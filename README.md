# tizen-game
# This Tizen-Wearable-Unity App is a simple implementation of a mini game for Gear S2.
# It was only tested on non-3G Gear S2.

# Our idea is to create and link a native tizen library with Unity accessing its native features i.e. Bezel and other sensors.

# This project is leaning proporsal only. This shouldn't be used commercially.

# Assets from example at http://phaser.io
